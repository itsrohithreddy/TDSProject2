## Key Insights from Analysis

### Basic Analysis
- **Missing Values**:  
```json
{'date': 0, 'language': 0, 'type': 0, 'title': 0, 'by': 0, 'overall': 0, 'quality': 0, 'repeatability': 0}
```

### Preprocessing Insights
- **Imputing Missing Values and Reasoning**:  
  - **`date`**: Replace with **median** to mitigate the influence of outliers.  
  - **`by`**: Replace with **most frequent** to preserve the mode of categorical data.

### Binnable Columns Insights
- **Binnable Columns and Reasoning**:  
  - **`overall`**: Binnable due to distinct categories.  
  - **`quality`**: Binnable due to distinct categories.  
  - **`repeatability`**: Binnable due to distinct categories.  

### Skewness Category
- **Features Segregation on Skewness**:  
  - **Left Skewed**: `repeatability`  
  - **Right Skewed**: `overall`, `quality`  
  - **Normally Distributed**: None  

## Visualizations and Insights

### Distribution of Ratings
![binnable_columns_distribution.png](binnable_columns_distribution.png)
- **Description**: The chart shows the distributions for Overall Ratings, Quality Ratings, and Repeatability Ratings across their respective ranges, with histograms and kernel density estimates displayed.
- **Insights**:  
  1. **Overall Ratings**: Multiple peaks suggest varied opinions, with a prominent peak around 3.5-4.0.  
  2. **Quality Ratings**: Similar to Overall Ratings, showing peaks around 3.5.  
  3. **Repeatability Ratings**: Clustered around 1.5, suggesting a consensus that repeatability is below average.

### Correlation Matrix
![correlation_matrix.png](correlation_matrix.png)
- **Description**: A heatmap illustrating correlations among `overall`, `quality`, and `repeatability`.
- **Insights**:  
  1. Strong correlation (0.83) between `overall` and `quality`.  
  2. Moderate correlation (0.51) between `overall` and `repeatability`.  
  3. Lower correlation (0.31) between `quality` and `repeatability`.

### Scatter Plot
![scatter_plot.png](scatter_plot.png)
- **Description**: Scatter plot showing the relationship between `overall` and `quality` ratings.
- **Insights**:  
  1. Points are dispersed, indicating a weak correlation between overall and quality scores.  
  2. High overall scores exist alongside varying quality assessments.  
  3. Varied quality perceptions among lower overall scores.

## Recommendations and Next Steps
- **Data Quality**: Address missing values and outliers for cleaner analysis.
- **Future Exploration**: Use clustering and PCA insights for segmentation and dimensionality reduction.
- **Operational Use**: Leverage time-series patterns for forecasting and geospatial trends for targeted decision-making.
